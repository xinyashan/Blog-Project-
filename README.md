# Blog-Project-
The final project I have worked on i.c.stars and continued to develop even after my internship. This is a blog that discusess about: Music and technology. I have been updating it a lot recently and adding more features on it as much as possible. 


My project is about music, technology, and culture! Some of the unique features I have offer on this work in progress website is a function where users get to see snippets of the concert videos as a guest but can view full length videos when they log in or sign up for account. The "Concert mode" feature is hidden when you view as a guest and will appear when you have created a account or successfully logged in 

Next, I also have created a back end feature where the user can edit the video infromation. I have used MySql to keep track of the table information about the video's name, information, and location.
